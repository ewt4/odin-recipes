    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fettuccine (Italian: [fettutˈtʃiːne]; lit. 'little ribbons'; sing. fettuccina) is a type of pasta popular in Roman and Tuscan cuisine. It is descended from the extremely thin capelli d'angelo of the Renaissance[1] but is a flat, thick pasta traditionally made of egg and flour (usually one egg for every 100 grams (3.5 oz) of flour). At about 0.25 inches (6.4 mm), it is wider and thicker than, but similar to, the tagliatelle typical of Bologna,[2][3] which are more common elsewhere in Italy and often used as a synonym. Chicken fettuccine has small added pieces of chicken</p>
